# api25-multimeter


## Minimal Viable Product

- Web Interface
  - Ability to switch reading mode
  - Plot information on graph or table.
  - show min / max values
- NodeMCU
  - Calibration of voltage by getting the mean of many polls over N seconds.
  - Meassure resistance by using the internal resistance voltage
  - Swap modes
  - Use cables to plot.
  - Meassure voltage in Millovolts (be able to swap max resistance, Vcc library?)
